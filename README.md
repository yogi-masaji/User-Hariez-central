# React Landing Page - Material UI [One Pirate theme](https://mui.com/store/previews/onepirate/)

## Description

This project was created with React and [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

It was designed to be used as a template for a landing page. I implemented [this existing template](https://mui.com/store/previews/onepirate/), I added a [Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) to it to navigate through the pages and some nice [animations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animation-on-scroll).

It's easy to edit and customize to your will. 

The additional libraries that have been used can be found in package.json

Live demo is not available yet ( still working on deploying it ) but you can run the project locally if you want to test it and build it if you want to add it to a deployed website. If you want to see the page, also check [this link](https://mui.com/store/previews/onepirate/) from Material UI.

If you need any extra information feel free to contact me at sanduteofil@gmail.com. Even if you need help with deploying it on the web.

* The original template and page content belongs entirely to Material UI. I just adapted the project locally so you don't have to and added the required routes to navigate in the application. 

Stay cool !

# React Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
